	The spine undergoes extension. The front leg experiences nutation, hip flexion, external rotation, and abduction, with knee flexion and ankle/foot supination. The back leg involves counternutation, hip extension, internal rotation, and adduction, with knee flexion and ankle plantarflexion.

Working Muscles
	The spinal extensors create the backbend, while the extensors and obliques maintain balance and orientation to the front. The back leg’s internal rotation and extension make the joint capsule taut, similar to Natarajasana. In the front leg, gravity is the main force, and the hamstrings, gluteus maximus, and peroneals work eccentrically to resist collapsing into the pose.

Lengthening Muscles
	When the front leg is abducted, the rotators (obturator externus and quadratus femoris) are slightly lengthened, but the hamstrings stretch more despite knee flexion. When the front leg is adducted, flexion and adduction of the hip lengthen the piriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli, with the obturator externus and quadratus femoris lengthening slightly less.

	As the front leg’s knee extends toward 90 degrees, hip rotation intensifies, and stretching may be felt in the gluteus medius, minimus, adductor magnus, or longus. This action increases pressure on the knee, especially if there is hip joint restriction, and makes the knee more vulnerable to twisting forces at 90 degrees. The feet and ankles help stabilize and protect the knee.

Spine: Neutral.
Hips: Neutral extension, adduction, internal rotation.
Knees: Extension.
Ankles & Feet: Dorsiflexion and eversion (bottom foot resisting gravity).
Scapulae: Neutral, abducting against gravity.
Shoulders (Glenohumeral Joint): Lateral abduction, external rotation.
Elbows: Extension.
Wrists & Forearms:
Bottom hand: Pronation, wrist dorsiflexion.
Top hand: Neutral forearm, neutral wrist extension.


Muscle Engagement
Spine & Core Stability:

Spinal extensors maintain neutral spinal alignment.
Rectus abdominis, transversus abdominis, and obliques stabilize the torso.
Quadratus lumborum resists the hips dropping.
Sternocleidomastoid (bottom side) & splenius capitis (top side) support head rotation upward.
Torso Mechanics:

Top side: External obliques concentrically resist the hips twisting forward; internal obliques eccentrically resist the hips falling backward.
Bottom side: Internal obliques concentrically pull the hip forward; external obliques eccentrically resist hip collapse.
Legs & Hip Stability:

Adductor magnus (top & bottom leg) internally rotates & extends the hips.
Hamstrings extend the hips.
Vastii muscles extend the knees.
Tibialis anterior & extensor digitorum dorsiflex the ankle and extend the toes.
Peroneal muscles evert the bottom foot against gravity.
Gluteus medius & minimus hold the hips off the floor (bottom leg).
Arms & Shoulder Stability:

Top Arm:
Infraspinatus & teres minor externally rotate the shoulder.
Serratus anterior, trapezius, and deltoid lift the arm.
Triceps extend the elbow.
Extensor carpi & extensor digitorum extend the wrist & fingers.
Bottom Arm:
Serratus anterior stabilizes the scapula against adduction.
Infraspinatus & teres minor externally rotate the shoulder.
Subscapularis & supraspinatus stabilize the humeral head.
Deltoid stabilizes the humerus.
Triceps extend the elbow.
Forearm pronators, flexor carpi ulnaris & radialis, and intrinsic hand muscles support the wrist & palm.


Muscles Lengthening
Latissimus dorsi (due to arm elevation).
Pectoralis major & minor (due to shoulder abduction & external rotation).
Coracobrachialis (due to arm extension & abduction).


Key Takeaways
Core activation is essential: Obliques, transverse abdominis, and quadratus lumborum prevent hip sagging.
Shoulder stabilization is crucial: Serratus anterior and rotator cuff muscles keep the scapula & humerus aligned.
Leg engagement maintains balance: Adductor magnus and peroneal muscles help keep the body lifted and stable.

Chatus Padasana (Four-Footed Pose / Bridge Pose Variation)
Joint Actions
Spine: Slight lumbar & thoracic extension; cervical extension.
Hips: Neutral extension, adduction, internal rotation.
Knees: Flexion.
Ankles: Dorsiflexion.
Scapulae: Downward rotation, adduction, elevation.
Shoulders (Glenohumeral Joint): Extension, external rotation.
Elbows: Extension.
Forearms & Wrists:
Forearm pronation.
Wrist dorsiflexion.


Muscle Engagement
Legs & Hip Stability:

Hamstrings & adductor magnus counteract gravity by maintaining hip extension, adduction, and internal rotation.
Gluteus maximus assists with hip extension, but must be controlled to prevent excessive external rotation.
Quadriceps (eccentrically) control knee flexion.
Tibialis anterior works to draw knees forward over the feet.
Arms & Shoulder Stability:

Rhomboids & middle trapezius work concentrically to adduct the scapulae.
Levator scapulae elevates the scapulae.
Teres major, triceps, posterior deltoids, and latissimus dorsi extend the arms and downwardly rotate the scapulae.
Triceps extend the elbows.
Forearm pronators rotate the palms downward.
Torso & Core Stability:

Obliques, rectus abdominis, and psoas minor resist lumbar hyperextension caused by gravity.


Muscles Lengthening
Legs: Quadriceps (eccentrically), iliacus, psoas major & minor.
Torso: Abdominal muscles (all layers active but lengthened), anterior neck muscles.
Arms: Pectoralis major & minor, coracobrachialis.
Key Takeaways
Leg engagement is crucial: The hamstrings, adductor magnus, and glutes prevent the hips from collapsing.
Scapular control is unique in this pose: Rhomboids and middle trapezius actively engage to stabilize the upper body.
Core activation balances extension: The abdominals and psoas minor control the spine to avoid overextension.
