	The spine undergoes extension. The front leg experiences nutation, hip flexion, external rotation, and abduction, with knee flexion and ankle/foot supination. The back leg involves counternutation, hip extension, internal rotation, and adduction, with knee flexion and ankle plantarflexion.

Working Muscles
	The spinal extensors create the backbend, while the extensors and obliques maintain balance and orientation to the front. The back leg’s internal rotation and extension make the joint capsule taut, similar to Natarajasana. In the front leg, gravity is the main force, and the hamstrings, gluteus maximus, and peroneals work eccentrically to resist collapsing into the pose.

Lengthening Muscles
	When the front leg is abducted, the rotators (obturator externus and quadratus femoris) are slightly lengthened, but the hamstrings stretch more despite knee flexion. When the front leg is adducted, flexion and adduction of the hip lengthen the piriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli, with the obturator externus and quadratus femoris lengthening slightly less.

	As the front leg’s knee extends toward 90 degrees, hip rotation intensifies, and stretching may be felt in the gluteus medius, minimus, adductor magnus, or longus. This action increases pressure on the knee, especially if there is hip joint restriction, and makes the knee more vulnerable to twisting forces at 90 degrees. The feet and ankles help stabilize and protect the knee.

The spine extends, while the hips experience mild flexion, adduction, and internal rotation. The knees extend, and the scapulae downwardly rotate and adduct. The glenohumeral joint extends, adducts, and internally rotates. The elbows flex, and the forearms pronate.

Working Muscles
The spinal extensors and lower fibers of the psoas major engage to maintain spinal extension.

In the legs, the psoas major, iliacus, pectineus, and tensor fascia latae contribute to hip flexion, while the hamstrings stabilize the legs, and the quadriceps assist in both hip flexion and knee extension.

In the arms, the subscapularis, teres major, and latissimus dorsi internally rotate the shoulders, with the latissimus dorsi and long head of the triceps also assisting in shoulder extension. The trapezius and rhomboids adduct the scapulae, while the forearm pronators turn the hands toward the floor.

Lengthening Muscles
The anterior neck muscles stretch, while the anterior rib cage expands with the internal intercostals lengthening. The abdominal muscles lengthen but work eccentrically to resist the forward displacement of the organs due to psoas activation. In the arms, the coracobrachialis, pectorals, long head of the biceps, serratus anterior, and anterior deltoids lengthen.

Anantasana
Joint Actions
The spine maintains its natural curves with lateral flexion. The lifted leg undergoes sacrum nutation, hip flexion, external rotation, abduction, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion. The bottom leg remains in hip neutral extension, internal rotation, and adduction, with knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion, and foot eversion for balance.

Working Muscles
The spine is stabilized by the obliques, with the internal obliques on the lifted leg side and external obliques on the opposite side resisting twisting.

In the top leg, the piriformis, obturator internus, and gemelli externally rotate and abduct the hip, while the posterior fibers of the gluteus medius and minimus assist in abduction. The quadriceps extend the knee, and the iliacus aids in hip flexion.

In the bottom leg, the hamstrings resist hip flexion caused by the lifted leg. The gluteus medius and minimus stabilize the pelvis, while the adductor magnus counteracts them to maintain pelvic balance.

Lengthening Muscles
In the top leg, the hamstrings, adductor magnus, gracilis, and pectineus stretch. In the bottom leg, the adductor longus, brevis, and gracilis lengthen.


Bhujangasana
Joint Actions
The spine extends, with the sacrum in counternutation. The hips extend, internally rotate, and adduct, while the knees extend and the ankles plantarflex. The scapulae remain neutral, possibly undergoing slight upward rotation. The glenohumeral joints externally rotate, the elbows extend, and the forearms pronate.

Working Muscles
The entire spinal extensor group—including intertransversarii, interspinalis, rotatores, multifidi, spinalis, semispinalis, splenius capitis and cervicis, longissimus, and iliocostalis—contracts concentrically to create spinal extension. The serratus posterior superior assists in chest expansion and supports the erector spinae, while the rectus abdominis and obliques work eccentrically to prevent excessive lumbar extension.

In the arms, the infraspinatus, teres minor, serratus anterior, posterior deltoids, triceps, pronator teres, and pronator quadratus engage to support the posture.

In the legs, the hamstrings, particularly the semitendinosus and semimembranosus, extend the hips while maintaining adduction and internal rotation. The adductor magnus (extensor portion) and deep/medial fibers of the gluteus maximus assist in hip extension without external rotation. The vastus lateralis, medialis, and intermedius extend the knees. Weak medial hamstrings can lead to excessive gluteus maximus engagement, causing external rotation or abduction of the legs.

Lengthening Muscles
In the spine, the rectus abdominis, obliques, external intercostals, longus colli and capitis, suprahyoid, infrahyoid, scalenes, and anterior longitudinal ligament lengthen.

In the arms, the latissimus dorsi, teres major, pectoralis major and minor, biceps, and supinators stretch.

In the legs, the rectus femoris, lower fibers of the psoas and iliacus, and tensor fascia latae lengthen due to hip extension.

Dhanurasana
Joint Actions
The spine extends, with the sacrum in counternutation. The hips extend, medially rotate, and adduct, while the knees flex and the ankles plantarflex. The scapulae adduct and elevate. The glenohumeral joints medially rotate, extend, and adduct. The elbows extend, the forearms pronate, and the fingers and hands flex to grasp the ankles.

Working Muscles
In the arms, the subscapularis, teres major, posterior deltoids, rhomboids, levator scapulae, and triceps stabilize the arm and scapula position. The pectoralis major and minor, coracobrachialis, anterior deltoids, and serratus anterior work eccentrically as they lengthen.

In the legs, the hamstrings (especially semitendinosus and semimembranosus), the extensor portion of the adductor magnus, and the deep and medial fibers of the gluteus maximus work to extend the hips. The vastus lateralis, medialis, and intermedius, along with the lower part of the rectus femoris, work to extend the knees.

Lengthening Muscles
Due to hip extension, the rectus femoris, lower fibers of the psoas, iliacus, and possibly the pectineus and tensor fascia latae lengthen.
